/**
 * Compiling a `TypeExpr` down to an Effect Schema.
 *
 * The point of writing our own type language was never to leave Effect Schema
 * behind - it was to stop borrowing *identity* from it. So the relationship is
 * one-directional and explicit: `TypeExpr` is the source of truth, and Schema
 * is a compilation target, alongside whatever else needs one (JSON Schema for
 * docs, a widget for the form builder, DDL for a relational mirror).
 *
 *     TypeExpr ──► Schema      decoding, parse errors, effect-form, HttpApi
 *        │    ──► JSON Schema  external contracts
 *        └── canonical ──► ContentId   identity, owned end to end
 *
 * Everything Effect Schema is good at survives. What does not survive - and
 * cannot, by construction - is a precise *static* type. A type a customer
 * created at 3pm has no TypeScript counterpart, so the result decodes to
 * `unknown` and callers narrow it themselves. That is not a shortcoming of the
 * compiler; it is what "types are runtime data" means.
