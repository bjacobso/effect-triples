/**
 * A content id: the SHA-256 of a canonically encoded value, rendered as
 * `sha256-<64 lowercase hex>`.
 *
 * The algorithm is in the string on purpose. Content ids are written to the
 * database and compared across deploys, so the day SHA-256 has to be replaced
 * the two generations must be able to coexist in one column rather than
 * requiring a flag day; a bare hex digest could not tell them apart.
 *
 * Every hash is domain-separated by a caller-supplied tag. Without it the
 * digest of a node body and the digest of an arbitrary string blob live in the
 * same space, and a value crafted to look like an encoded node could be passed
 * off as one.
 *
 * The hash itself is `Sha256`, not `node:crypto`, so this module works in the
 * browser. The configuration kernel has to decode and validate the same
 * declarations on the server, in the authoring UI, in the CLI and in tests, and
 * a Node-only identity function would force a second implementation of the one
 * thing that must never have two.
